# MVC_PartyManager_App
Fairly simple app to manage parties, add invitations, and send those invitations


First step is make sure the database connection string fits what SQL you have installed. I was using SQLEXPRESS so that is what it is set to by default.

Second step is to run Update-Database in the Nuget console.

Third step is to try running it.

Fourth step is add your gmail account and app password to the email sending service class if you want to be able to test the email sending portion.
